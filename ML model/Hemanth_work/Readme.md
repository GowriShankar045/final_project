## Find the Pretrained model here
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a3H-pFoH12YzdiIMJoGQV_pv5yxmeP_t?usp=sharing
Navigate here and unload the ".h5" file which you can use for predictions
## Method used
Using Deep Learning to classifiy whether the person has the disease or not, the person will be asked 
to upload two pictures where he will be asked to draw a spiral and a wave pic based on which the model will work
Initially two models are trained to separately learn the features and later they are merged with help of two layers.
The model is saved in .h5 format
